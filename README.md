A basic HTML file with built in css (no external files required) (I do reference alot of external websites, they aren't required for the list to function but they can be helpful)

You can download and use this html list offline, the linked websites just may need a conncetion to function

Just has my wishlist, it was a fun project, and I'm using github pages to make it easy to share it

I really didn't need to make it a website, but I think it's more cool like this. Just having a .txt was boring
